# GifTastic

## An App made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and GIPHY API

## Overview

 * The App takes the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML
 
 * When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page
 
 * When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
